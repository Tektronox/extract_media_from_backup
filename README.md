# iPhone 6 media extraction script
Simple python script to extract media (photos and videos) from iPhone 6 backup. 

Useful if you have somehow damaged the iPhone (that didn't have cloud sync enabled) so that it still can be recognized by PC (in order to make a backup) and want to get access to media from it. The "right" way then is to use other iPhone with this backup, but sometimes it can be inconvenient (when you don't have a second iPhone available).

There are paid programs that are created specifically for this purpose, but after carefully looking at contents of the backup directory it turned out that it is quite easy to do it with a simple script.

I'm sharing it in hope that it might be useful for someone.
